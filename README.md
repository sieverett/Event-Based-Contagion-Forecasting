## Background
> Understanding the social dimensions of spread of disease requires an acute of understanding <br>
of the aggregated behavior among groups with information asymettries and diversity in risk tolerance. <br>
Few models incorporate the rise in the politization of information that confirms or rejects potential <br>
risk factors for the spread of disease. This analysis looks specific cases of large scale events asseses <br>
the potential for spread, and weighs the event against the information about potential health risks <br>
that precedes these events.
