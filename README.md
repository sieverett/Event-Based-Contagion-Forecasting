# Event-Based-Contagion-Forecasting
@sieverett

## Background
> We propose an event-based contagion forecasting model that considers the social dimensions of spread. <br>
The model proposes consideration of the aggregated behavior among groups, information asymettries and <br>
diversity in risk tolerance. <br>
Few models incorporate the rise in the politization of information that confirms or rejects potential <br>
risk factors for the spread of disease. This analysis looks specific cases of large scale events asseses <br>
the potential for spread, and weighs the event against the information about potential health risks <br>
that precedes these events.
